This project helps in Food Demand Prediction for desired cuisine.
The project will take details about a dish in input and then based on the region given it will predict demand of orders in it.

Food_Prediction.ipynb trains the model and saves the model.
FoodDemand.ipynb file needs to be executed to get the result as this contains the Demand prediction code.
